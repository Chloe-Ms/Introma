  content: "Hello Sir,\r\nSorry to bother you again with this, but this story really
    held my attention. I\u2019ve called the company that handled the renovations
    and they assured me that no additional fees has been requested. In addition,
    there is no mention of this expense in our bankbook. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nRosemary
